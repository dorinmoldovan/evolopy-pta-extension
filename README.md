# Features

- Seven nature-inspired algorithms were applied:
  - Cuckoo Search (CS)
  - Crow Search Algorithm (CSA)
  - Chicken Swarm Optimization (CSO)
  - Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO)
  - Horse Optimization Algorithm (HOA)
  - Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
  - Plum Tree Algorithm (PTA)
- 24 objective functions were applied.
- 1 machine learning application was presented.

## Installation

Create a new folder at the following location:

    C:\Users\Admin\.venv

Create a new virtual environment using the command:

    python -m venv evolopy-pta-extension

Activate the virtual environment using the command:

    C:\Users\Admin\.venv\evolopy-pta-extension\Scripts\activate

Install the requirements using the command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Deactivate the virtual environment using the command:

    C:\Users\Admin\.venv\evolopy-pta-extension\Scripts\deactivate

Run the app using the command:

    python simulator.py
