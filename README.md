  - Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO)
  - Horse Optimization Algorithm (HOA)
  - Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
  - Plum Tree Algorithm (PTA)
- 24 objective functions were applied.
- 1 machine learning application was presented.

## Installation

Create a new folder at the following location:

    C:\Users\Admin\.venv

Create a new virtual environment using the command:

    python -m venv evolopy-pta-extension
